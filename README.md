# Energy Consumption Time Series Forecasting

## Overview
This repository contains advanced time series forecasting models designed for predicting energy consumption. The primary goal is to optimize energy distribution networks and enhance operational efficiency by accurately forecasting future energy consumption patterns. These models utilize historical data to capture trends, seasonality, and complex relationships, which are crucial for informed decision-making regarding resource allocation and infrastructure planning.

Collaborators and stakeholders are invited to explore and contribute to this repository, driving advancements in sustainable energy management.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the **International Energy Agency (IEA)** monthly electricity statistics. It includes valuable attributes such as:
- Net Electricity Production
- Electricity used for pumped storage
- Distribution Losses of different countries
- Other useful metrics

## Models Implemented

### 1. ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average)
The ARMA model is a classic time series forecasting technique that captures both the autoregressive and moving average components of the energy consumption data. By analyzing historical values and lagged errors, the ARMA model enables accurate predictions of future energy usage.

### 2. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
LSTM is a deep learning technique adept at capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data. This model employs recurrent neural networks with memory cells to learn and predict energy consumption patterns, taking into account both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.

### 3. SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
The SARIMA model is a powerful forecasting method that considers seasonal patterns within the data. By integrating autoregressive, moving average, and seasonal components, SARIMA accurately predicts energy consumption based on historical data trends and seasonal effects.

## Requirements
To run this implementation, you need Python 3.7 or later. The following libraries are required:
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Statsmodels**: For statistical modeling
- **TensorFlow**: Required for implementing the LSTM model
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization
- **Seaborn** (optional): For enhanced visualization capabilities

## Usage
To use the models, ensure you have the necessary dataset in the specified format. You may need to adapt the code to fit your specific dataset.
